# Machine-Learning-Framework-for-Automated-Kidney-and-Liver-Disease-Diagnosis
This work presents a machine learning-based diagnostic system for automated kidney and liver disease analysis. Our approach leverages advanced ML algorithms to analyze clinical data, medical imaging, and laboratory results to provide early detection and accurate classification of kidney and liver pathologies.
